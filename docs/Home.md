**Project Description**  
This project contains an API that you can use to convert XML into comma separated values (CSV). It comes with a Windows Forms client application; just download the binary from the downloads page, unzip and double click Moor.XmlToCsvConverter.exe to execute. It is programmed in C#4.0.

**Background  
**This program was originally authored as part of a software package designed to identify, classify and report on Poor Households in remote areas for the Cambodian Ministry of Planning as part of the [IDPoor project](http://www.mop.gov.kh/Projects/IDPoor/tabid/154/Default.aspx "IDPoor Project ").

**Command Line Support**  
As of version 1.5 a command line tool for XML to CSV is included which let system admins convert xml to csv as automated batch operations from a command line prompt.
